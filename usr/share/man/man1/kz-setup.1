ubuntu) and <edition> (desktop or server) are populated with the values from
the current computer.
.br
For example, kz-setup-setup-ubuntu-desktop.sh.
.sp
This input file contains commands for all users (USERs) included in it for
Ubuntu desktop.
.br
When processing the input file, the commands for the current user (USER) are
selected and copied to a command file.
.br
A USER is defined in this context as <username>@<computername>, e.g. jan@pc02
or * (any user).
.sp
Option \fB-a\fR, \fB--apps\fR lists apps available in all standard input files,
or in the \fIFILE\fR provided with option \fB-f\fR, \fB--file\fR.
.sp
It is possible to specify \fIAPP\fRs. Per specified \fIAPP\fR, the commands for
the current user (USER) and \fIAPP\fR are selected from the input file and are
copied to a command file.

.SH FILE FORMAT

are processed.
