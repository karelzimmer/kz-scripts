.SH DESCRIPTION
This file contains commands to process as an installation file with kz install.
.br
Commands containing personal information, such as a username, are included in
an encrypted installation file, kz-install.sh.gpg.
.sp
The installation file contains so-called \fBapp record\fRs and
\fBcommand record\fRs.
.sp
The \fBapp record\fR indicates where the commands should be executed and is
followed by one or more lines of commands (\fBcommand record\fRs).
.sp
An \fBapp record\fR consists of five parts, each part separated by one space,
like '# install <app> on <hosts>' and '# remove <app> from <hosts>'.
.br
1. #        (comment symbol)
.br
2. <action> (install or remove)
.br
3. <app>    (the name of the app)
.br
4. on       (from if <action> is remove)
.br
5. <hosts>  (the name of the computer or computers)
.br
This is followed by one or more \fBcommand record\fRs containing commands for
<app>.
.sp
See \fBTable 1\fR which \fBtypes\fR of records there are and how these records
are processed.
.sp
See \fBTable 2\fR for an \fBexample\fR of these records and how these records
are processed.
More examples can be seen through the \fBkz install --browse\fR and
\fBkz install --cat\fR commands.
